Diodes are silk screened with square on cathode(-).
Cathode is negative (gnd) side with band on diode.  
RON SAYS TO PUT THE CATHODE (-) INTO SQUARE HOLE.
NOTE: use the other diode symbol next time.

NOTE: C2/D4 labeling needs clarification

Order Of Assembly
1. caps C1, C2, C3, C4
2. diodes D1-4
3. resistors R1-8 and RV1
4. transistor Q1
5. wind and install toroids T1, T2. 
   consider insulated wire here
6. socket for LM358 (if you plan to socket this)
