Changes for V2.0

1. move barrel jack further out on edge of board so it's closer to case 
   HOW FAR?
### LM358 supplied with +12V instead of +5V
2. REMOVE trace from LM358 pin 8 to pin 1 on relay K2
3. REMOVE BOTTOM trace from LM358 pin 8 to C3 pin 1
4. ADD whitewire on BOTTOM from LM358 pin 8 to J2 (barrel jack) pin 1 (+12V)
5. ADD whitewire on BOTTOM from C3 pin 1 to K2 (relay) pin 1

Your items 2,3,4&5 â€¦.. on the next version just reroute the trace
that goes from RV1 to the LM358 then to the relay coil to just go
from RV1 to the relay coil and then add a trace from +12v to pin 8
of the LM358.

6. label diodes better
7. U1 & Q1 would be better with 0.1" pin spacing
8. ---
9. pad a bit of space around RV1 so we can use alternate parts
10. C2/D4 labeling needs clarification
11. REMOVE silkscreen 1N270 (two places)
12. board mounting holes need more spacing away from circuit traces
