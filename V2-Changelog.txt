Changes for V2.0

_X_ move barrel jack further out on edge of board so it's closer to case 
    HOW FAR?  Put silk screen just over edge of board so jack is very 
    close to faceplate.
_X_ After much discussion this reduces to: put +12V on LM358 pin 8. Done.
    ### LM358 supplied with +12V instead of +5V
_X_ label diodes better
_X_ U1 & Q1 would be better with 0.1" pin spacing
_X_ pad a bit of space around RV1 so we can use alternate parts
    hacked courtyard to be 9x9mm and slid up
_X_ C2/D4 labeling needs clarification
_X_ REMOVE silkscreen 1N270 (two places)
_X_ board mounting holes need more spacing away from circuit traces
    (PCB) File / Board Setup / Copper to edge clearance: 1.0mm (was 0.1mm)
_X_ center BNC connectors on board edge to make case drilling easier
