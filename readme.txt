My notes to myself about problems, solutions, ideas, questions, ...

1. confirmed: I can use wire between the two BNC connectors and skip coax
2. windings on toroids are both 1:12.  On 1st toroid the center conductor
   passes through once, but then continues to 2nd toroid and loops 12x.
3. OPEN does Ron want to pick a license for this?
4. when we get to calibration step, but guess is something like
   4a. 50 Ohm dummy load, apply pwr and verify it works
   4b. 100 Ohm dummy load (2:1 SWR), apply power and tune pot until it cuts out
5. when the detector fires, the only reset is to power off / power on unit.
   I can see a need for a power switch to save the barrel plugs some wear.
6. we have an LED for BadStuffHappened.  Any value in pwr LED?
7. transformers are just FT37-43 ferrite toroids
8. 1/4 watt resistors are fine. Nothing fancy; 10% tolerance or better is fine
9. Capacitors can be ordinary ceramic discs, 50 volts is sufficient 
10. "Normal" LEDs are 5mm size
11. A common ½W resistor measures about 9.2mm across, 
    while a smaller ¼W resistor is about 6.3mm long.
