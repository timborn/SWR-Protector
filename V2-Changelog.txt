Changes for V2.0

1. move barrel jack further out on edge of board so it's closer to case 
   HOW FAR?
### LM358 supplied with +12V instead of +5V
2. REMOVE trace from LM358 pin 8 to pin 1 on relay K2
3. REMOVE BOTTOM trace from LM358 pin 8 to C3 pin 1
4. ADD whitewire on BOTTOM from LM358 pin 8 to J2 (barrel jack) pin 1 (+12V)
5. ADD whitewire on BOTTOM from C3 pin 1 to K2 (relay) pin 1
6. label diodes better
7. U1 & Q1 would be better with 0.1" pin spacing
8. pretty sure Ron had additional comments I cannot find ...
9. pad a bit of space around RV1 so we can use alternate parts
10. C2/D4 labeling needs clarification
11. REMOVE silkscreen 1N270 (two places)
12. board mounting holes need more spacing away from circuit traces
