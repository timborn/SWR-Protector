Diodes are silk screened with square on cathode(-).
Cathode is negative (gnd) side with band on diode.  
RON SAYS TO PUT THE CATHODE (-) INTO SQUARE HOLE.
NOTE: use the other diode symbol next time.

NOTE: C2/D4 labeling needs clarification

Order Of Assembly
1. caps C1, C2, C3, C4
2. diodes D1-4
3. resistors R1-8 and RV1
4. transistor Q1
5. voltage regulator U1
6. wind and install toroids T1, T2. 
   consider insulated wire here
7. socket for LM358 (if you plan to socket this)
8. power connectors, BNC connectors
9. relay


Calibration
-----------
1. verify 12v on input
2. verify 5v on header pins
3. verify 12v on output
4. no LED light
5. measure pin 2 on LM358 and adjust pot 
   Ron suggests 370mV
   Tim ended up at 1.25V
6. say a prayer and try it
   If you have a dummy load, you should be able to xmit into it without 
   tripping.
   Otherwise raise voltage until the dummy load works.
   If you have a 2:1 dummy load, you can adjust until that just trips.
   That will put an upper limit on the amount of reflected pwd allowed.

   If you think your ref voltage is "too high", you can check the
   voltage from radio to see what it is comparing to.  Using a 100
   Ohm load (2:1) you can power the radio directly and leave the
   protector unpowered and measure the voltage on pin 3 of LM358
   when keying (briefly) and see what voltage the comparator is
   comparing itâ€™s reference (pin 2) to.
