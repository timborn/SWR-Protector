Lots of details and photos on github:
https://github.com/timborn/SWR-Protector
NB to see the schematics and PCB from V1, git has a tag 'V1.0'.
Of course the documentation is often learned later, so the more
recent version in git probably has better documentation (like this!).

On V1.0 boards ONLY there are two white wire changes required.

On the component side, there is a trace running diagonally between 
LM358 and K1.  Cut that trace.  See photo 
SWR-Protector/docs/v1.0/SWR Protector V1 white wire mod top.jpg
in git.

On the back side, there are three traces running diagonally, in parallel.
They are all under LM358.  The lower trace trace that snakes around pin 4
of the LM328 needs to be cut.  See photo 
SWR-Protector/docs/v1.0/SWR Protector V1 white wire mod bottom.jpg
in git.

Solder white wires on the back.
Solder white wire #1 between +12V lug (pin 1) on J2 and pin 8 (Vcc) on LM358.
Solder white wire #2 between K2 pin 1 (+5V) and RV1 pin 1 (+5V).

#include BOM

Diodes are silk screened with square on cathode(-).
Cathode is negative (gnd) side with band on diode.  
RON SAYS TO PUT THE CATHODE (-) INTO SQUARE HOLE.
NOTE: use the other diode symbol next time.

NOTE: C2/D4 labeling needs clarification

Order Of Assembly
1. caps C1, C2, C3, C4
2. diodes D1-4
3. resistors R1-8 and RV1
4. transistor Q1
5. voltage regulator U1
6. wind and install toroids T1, T2. 
   consider insulated wire here
7. socket for LM358 (if you plan to socket this)
8. power connectors, BNC connectors
9. relay


Calibration
-----------
1. verify 12v on input
2. verify 5v on header pins
3. verify 12v on output
4. no LED light
5. measure pin 2 on LM358 and adjust pot 
   Ron suggests 370mV
   Tim ended up at 1.35V
6. say a prayer and try it
   If you have a dummy load, you should be able to xmit into it without 
   tripping.
   Otherwise raise voltage until the dummy load works.
   If you have a 2:1 dummy load, you can adjust until that just trips.
   That will put an upper limit on the amount of reflected pwd allowed.

   If you think your ref voltage is "too high", you can check the
   voltage from radio to see what it is comparing to.  Using a 100
   Ohm load (2:1) you can power the radio directly and leave the
   protector unpowered and measure the voltage on pin 3 of LM358
   when keying (briefly) and see what voltage the comparator is
   comparing itâ€™s reference (pin 2) to.
