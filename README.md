# SWR-Protector
SWR Protection Circuit - cuts power when SWR is too high

This design is from Ron WA7GIL.
He posted it on the QRP Labs forum in early 2023.

V1.0 came back from the fab in May.  Only 2 whitewire fixes.  You
can grab the Gerber and build your own if you don't mind fixing it
when it gets back.

The whitewire changes were solved with a single change to the
schematics, so V1.1 or better of the schematics would be the one
to look at.

V2.0 in the works.
